# Introduction

This guide walks through the setup of a Kubernetes cluster using `K3S` distribution , a lightweight Kubernetes distribution designed for environments with limited resources.

**The setup integrates:**
- **🔐 WireGuard VPN** for secure communication between nodes, 
- **🌐 Calico CNI** for networking and security policies, 
- **⚖️ MetalLB** for load balancing. 

**Additionally, the guide covers configuring:** 
- **🌍 NGINX Ingress Controller** for managing HTTP/HTTPS traffic and integrating **Cert-Manager** to automate TLS certificate management using Let's Encrypt.
- **ArgoCD Installation**

#### 🛠️ Key Components:

- **[🔐 WireGuard VPN](https://www.wireguard.com)**:
  - Ensures secure communication between your nodes: `master-01`, `worker-01`, and `cloud-vm`.
  - **Full Mesh Network**: Every node is connected directly to all other nodes (master-01, worker-01, and cloud-vm). This reduces the dependency on any single node and improves fault tolerance, minimizing packet loss.

- **[🦾 K3s](https://docs.k3s.io/)**:
  - A lightweight version of Kubernetes that’s easy to install, uses half the memory, and is contained in a binary under 100 MB—ideal for resource-constrained environments.

- **[🌐 Calico CNI](https://docs.tigera.io/calico/latest/about/)**:
  - Provides networking for the cluster, including pod communication and enforcing network policies for secure communication.

- **[⚖️ MetalLB](https://metallb.universe.tf/)**:
  - Acts as a load balancer for your bare-metal Kubernetes cluster, assigning external IPs to services within a specified IP range.

- **[🌍 NGINX Ingress Controller](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/overview/about/)**:
  - Controls external access to Kubernetes services by routing HTTP/HTTPS traffic within the cluster.
  - Uses [Kubernetes Ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/) to route traffic to the correct services based on defined rules.

- **[☁️ Cloudflare DNS](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/concepts/)**:
  - Handles DNS and traffic routing for your domain, directing requests to your cloud-vm (virtual machine).

- **[🔄 NGINX on cloud-vm](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/web-server/reverse-proxy/)**:
  - Configured as a reverse proxy to forward HTTP/HTTPS traffic from the public internet to your Kubernetes cluster over the VPN.
